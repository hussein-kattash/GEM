# GEM Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple yet polished tic-tac-toe experience built with Svelte and Vite. Challenge a friend locally, keep track of wins, and enjoy a responsive interface that looks great on any screen size.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at http://localhost:5173 by default. Vite supports hot module replacement, so any edits to the Svelte components will update instantly in the browser.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` – generate an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run check` – run `svelte-check` for type and accessibility diagnostics.

## Gameplay features

- Alternating starting player after each completed round.
- Scoreboard that tracks wins for X and O as well as draws.
- Clear status messaging with accessible announcements for screen readers.
- Responsive, touch-friendly layout with subtle animations.

Have fun!
